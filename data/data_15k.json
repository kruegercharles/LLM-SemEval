I thought that I had paid and wanted to get inside. However the bus driver called me and asked me in an impolite way if the coins were stuck at the opening of the box. He had not seen me paying and there wasn't a stack of coins in the box. I could not understand this and the driver kept questioning me. He made me feel angry and at last i inserted a dollar coin in the box just to get away from him. Later I found that I had forgotten a few coins in my pocket and had not paid enough for the fair the first time. After I had entered the bus I could still hear him scolding me and I felt disgusted.",
